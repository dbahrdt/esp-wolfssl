# WolfSSL
This repository contains almost all files that you get when "installing" WolfSSL into your `ESP_IDF` path.
However this way you can:
 1. Track the changes
 2. Use it as a component in your project

In the future we may simply pull in WolfSSL as a submodule.

# License
WolfSSL is governed by the GPLv2 which may not be compatible with other libraries that you are using in your project.
This may even pose a problem for FLOSS projects.
